# CPSC 329 Unessay: Phising Quiz
This is a phishing email quiz that tests if a user can differentiate between a phishing message and a legitimate message. 

The user will be provided two types of questions: 
1. Given two images, choose which one is the phising message and which is the legitimate message
2. Given an image, choose whether it is a phising or a legitimate message

Hints are provided for each question that are meant to assist the user in answering the qustions.\
A result page will appear after the completion of the test, in which the test results are displayed.

# Installation
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The following technologies were and tools were used to build our project:
* React JS (JavaScript) 
* Node.js 
* CSS
* HTML

## Node.js
First, you need to download [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (LTS version is recommended for most users)

## Download Files From GitHub 
Download all the files from GitHub (**note to authors**: insert link to build file here)

## Run From Terminal
Go to the root directory of the project and start the project using:
### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.


## Other Available Scripts

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
